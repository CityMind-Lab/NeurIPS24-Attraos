# [NeurIPS2024] Attractor memory for long-term time series forecasting: A chaos perspective
[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11463) | [Openreview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fEYHZzN7kX&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DNeurIPS.cc%2F2024%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions))

This is an official implementation of Attraos, which incorporates chaos theory
into Time Series Forecasting, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems.

## 🎉 What's New

* Oct 2024: We have introduced a plug-and-play [physical embedding module](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06651) that boosts performance by 50%, reduces model parameters by 10x, and speeds up computations by 3x.

* Oct 2024: Code released.

* Sep 2024: Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS2024.


## ✅ TODO

- [ ] Improve docstrings and documentation

- [ ] Validating Attraos' performance on large-scale chaotic datasets
