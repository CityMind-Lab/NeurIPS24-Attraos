# [NeurIPS2024] Attractor memory for long-term time series forecasting: A chaos perspective
[Paper Link] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11463)
[Openreview] (https://openreview.net/forum?id=fEYHZzN7kX&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DNeurIPS.cc%2F2024%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions))

This is an official implementation of Attraos, which incorporates chaos theory
into Time Series Forecasting, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems.
